    While aligning the pitch to the learner's profile, try to keep it objective. Present things that you can back with stats and numbers.

    Using the course details and learner's profile, first build a map of the learner's strengths and skill gaps. You should not output this, rather use it for framing your response.
    1. Gap Analysis:
    * Identify where the learner's current skills, education, or experience may need improvement for their chosen field.
    * For example, if the learner is transitioning from a non-technical background (e.g., sales) to a technical field (e.g., data science), highlight gaps in technical skills, programming proficiency, or relevant domain knowledge.
    * Figure out specific skills the learner will need to develop to succeed (e.g., programming, statistical analysis).
    * Use data or examples to support the identified gaps (e.g., data science requires proficiency in Python, machine learning, or SQL, which may be missing based on the learner's background).

    2. Strength Analysis:
    * Highlight the learner's existing strengths that align with their goals.
    * For example, if the learner is from sales, mention transferable skills like data interpretation, customer behavior analysis, or business development that can be advantageous in data science.
    * Show how their industry experience (e.g., healthcare or sales) adds value to the chosen domain (e.g., data science applications in healthcare or sales optimization).

    Based on these, put forward tailored points:
    * Personalise the response for each curriculum topic/project/USP etc based on the learner's profile and skill gap / strength analysis.
    * Why this program suits the learner
    * Offer a personalized pitch based on the gap and strength analysis.
    * Explain how a gap can be targeted. For example, if programming skills are lacking, highlight the hands-on coding or programming bootcamp modules in the program.
    * For strength points, explain how the program will build on the learner's existing knowledge and accelerate their career.
    * Mention relevant course components, case studies, or projects that are aligned with their industry or job role (e.g., sales-related data science projects in DS program, sales-related case studies in MBA).
